          Hi, I'm Masud Rana, a junior web developer with a passion for
          programming and technology. I specialize in building intuitive and
          user-friendly websites using the MERN stackâ€”MongoDB, Express.js,
          React, and Node.js. Alongside my programming journey, I have
          professional experience as an HVAC technician, showcasing my diverse
          skill set.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg my-4 leading-relaxed">
          I'm dedicated to learning and growing as a developer, staying updated
          with the latest web technologies to deliver modern and effective
          solutions. Whether it's front-end design or back-end logic, I love
          bringing ideas to life through code.
